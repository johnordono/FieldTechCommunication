BACKGROUND
*A user in this application would be a field technician. 
*Field technicians will be able to communicate with other field technicians through a ticketing system.
*The ticketing system will allow them to log what they have done and what they think needs to be done.
*Technicians following the ticket will be able to see the work that has been done to avoid doing the same tasks previously tried.
*This would boost efficiency by cutting down visit times.
