# FieldTechCommunication

Often times, field technicians will have to go to a location for the same problem more than once. The goal of this project is to create a web application which allows field techs to communicate among each other about issues at the same location, through updates on what has been done and what else needs to be done. This would allow them to be be more efficient and would greatly reduce time spent on visits. This is based on other ticketing systems, but this will be geared more toward Spectrum field technicians.
